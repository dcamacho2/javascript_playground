javascript_studies
==================

Some small projects used to learn javascript!


##Angular testing
Quick and easy builds to test out angular. Kinda like dipping my toes here! A lot of cool stuff, here I use filttering features as well as text modification. Will definetly do more stuff with angular, so keep an eye out!

##Instagram api
I was messing around with the Instagram api for a work project and managed to make it work! Uses jquery to fetch the data, data is returned as a json object where you are able to pick what you want. 


##Javascript animation (matrix effect)
When I was working on my first portfolio I wanted to showcase both design and coding skills, I  had a preaty clear idea on what I wanted to do. However I ended up moving away from this idea and never got around to finish this idea cause I had others haha. Still pretty cool effects done with javascript, the first was my first try which was a little more 'free spirited' and the second one was the original. Different properties can be changed!

##Working on html canvas
Really quick work with canvas in html, just shapes drawn out and images loaded.
